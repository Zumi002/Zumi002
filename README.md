## About me:

I'm a student of Computer Science and Information Systems at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at Warsaw University of Technology. 

Iâ€™m passionate about high-performance computing, computer graphics, and software engineering. 
I enjoy working on projects involving GPUs, CUDA and real-time rendering ðŸŽ®.
Iâ€™m also a fan of programming challenges like LeetCode and Advent of Code, which I treat as fun daily puzzles ðŸ§©.
