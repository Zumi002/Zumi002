Hi, I'm Marcin
</h1>

## About me:

I'm a student of Computer Science and Information Systems at the Faculty of Mathematics and Information Science at Warsaw University of Technology. 

Iâ€™m passionate about high-performance computing, computer graphics, and software engineering. 
I enjoy working on projects involving GPUs, CUDA and real-time rendering ðŸŽ®.
Iâ€™m also a fan of programming challenges like LeetCode and Advent of Code, which I treat as fun daily puzzles ðŸ§©.

## Latest projects:
- [3DRenderer](https://github.com/Zumi002/3DRenderer) - Simple 3D rendering engine made in C# using OpenTK.
- [CUDA-CSG-Tree-Raycasting](https://github.com/Zumi002/CUDA-CSG-Tree-Raycasting) - 3D Raycaster made with OpenGL and CUDA for real-time rendering of CSG-trees.
- [CUDA-FishSimulation](https://github.com/Zumi002/CUDA-FishSimulation) - High-performance 2D boids simulation made with OpenGL and CUDA.
- [BezierSurfaceRenderer](https://github.com/Zumi002/BezierSurfaceRenderer) - Simple CPU renderer for third-degree BÃ©zier surfaces.
- [PolygonEditor](https://github.com/Zumi002/PolygonEditor) - Interactive application designed for creating and modifying polygons with advanced geometric constraints.
